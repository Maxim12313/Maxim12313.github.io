                    Use WASD or arrow keys to move. Use LEFTCLICK to set off cooldown explosions at your cursor that kill enemeies. You have HP that regenerates and when you take damage, you become briefly invulnerable. There are four types of enemies: Laser, FastRunner, SlowRunner, and SplitShot. The Laser is small and green, and travels towards a random point in the center, then on  a timer, it prepares a laser shot at the exact coordinates of the player. The player has some time to react before the laser activates. The FastRunner is small, purple, and fast. It follows the player quickly, with more frequent updates with its velocity to reach the player, meaning more accurate movements. The SlowRunner is turquoise, big, and slow. It travels towards the player with less precise movements, but with a devastating damage if hit. The SplitShot travels randomely in one direction horizontaly or vertically, never diagnoly. On a timer, it begins to shoot shots out from its center. Each enemy has a designated lifespan, so it's not absolutely nescessary to kill all of them. As time passes, the spawn rate increases. The point of the game is to survive as long as possible.
